We hold space for everyone to feel safe, welcome, and relaxed. Our team maintains clear boundaries and upholds a culture of mutual respect. Clothing is always optional — comfort and consent are key.

The sauna garden is maintained with love and attention. Saunas are kept fresh, plunge water is changed regularly, and all spaces are cleaned throughout the day. Clean towels and clear guidance ensure a smooth experience.								

Connection & Presence				

This is more than just a sauna — it’s a space to breathe, reset, and reconnect. Whether you come alone or with friends, we welcome you into a warm community where people share fire, stories, and stillness.								

Tim the sauna master				

Tim found his love of sauna culture while working with the legendary Lost Horizon Nomadic Spa, a wood fired, solar powered wandering festival sauna, cafe and music stage. The most gentle, loving and original creation crew of the Uk’s mobile sauna festival culture.

Before this, Tim enjoyed many years pretending to be an international superstar dj and hosting parties all over London!  Tim hosts his sauna garden with the same passion he holds for enjoying a sauna; with compassion, care and simple frivolity.  Sauna made him the man he is today. A statement with all the wisdom of the blood sweat and tears of determination, or a cheeky laugh at the wonder that he made it this far!

Common Questions				

HOW LONG IS A SAUNA SESSION FOR A GUEST?

The duration of time that guests spend in the sauna can vary depending on personal preference, but a typical sauna session lasts anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes, with maybe 3 or 4 rounds between the sauna and the plunge pool; heating up and cooling down. Some guests may prefer longer sessions, but it is important to stay within your own comfort level and not exceed the recommended time for health and safety reasons. Sauna session duration is also dependent on the heat of the room. Usually novice sauna users enjoy a temperature between 50 – 70 degrees celsius, while experienced sauna lovers enjoy a hotter 70 – 90+ degrees celsius!

HOW HOT DOES THE SAUNA GET?

Our sauna can reach temperatures of up to 90 degrees Celsius (194 degrees Fahrenheit) but, if guests feel the heat is too much, there is a vent to let in cooling air, or the door can simply be opened until the temperature drops.

SHOULD I SHOWER BEFORE I ENTER THE SAUNA?

We ask that all guests shower before their sauna session. A cold shower stimulates and fully prepares guests for the heat inside the sauna! To maintain clean sauna benches we also ask guests to bring an extra towel to sit on.

CAN I BRING MY OWN FOOD AND DRINKS TO THE SAUNA GARDEN?

Yes, you can bring your own food and drinks to the sauna garden, and all we ask is that you clean up after yourself and dispose of any waste properly.

Step inside...				

Sauna culture is a simple dance between hot and cold; heating up the body, then cooling it down, repeatedly, until we reach the desired state of euphoric bliss and full robust health.								

Say Hello

THE SAUNA				

The caravan is a 1969 Thomson Glenn, able to seat up to 12 guests, beautifully renovated to visually stand out at any event, and fastidiously  insulated to maintain a good heat throughout the day. Open the door & you step into a world of wood, fire, stones & steam.								

THE GARDEN				

Safely ensconced within the privacy fencing, sauna guests are liberated to pursue their sauna rituals as comfortably as they feel, whether they be naked or wearing a bathing suit, all are welcome & there is no judgement. 
We are focused that the plunge pool is full of icy cold water, the showers have strong water pressure, the changing tent is clean and dry, the firebowl is roaring, and there is plenty of filtered drinking water for all guests.								

THE HEAT				

Heated by an industry standard Harvia M3 stove, we responsibly source kiln-dried/or seasoned oak and ash from local wood suppliers. 
We love to add a few drops of essential oils to our steam, to wake our souls up in the mornings, or relax in the evenings.								

THE PLUNGE				

The cold water of the plunge pool is the counterbalance to the heat of the sauna, & equally vital in sauna culture. At 6’ round it can seat up to 8 people comfortably. 
The water is changed at the end of each day, & the pool is sterilised with biodegradable soap.								

THE SHOWERS				

The showers are hidden behind bamboo fencing, maintaining privacy during the act of washing & cleaning oneself. Depending on the size of event, up to six showers can be provided, with shower trays to efficiently pipe waste water away, while guests wash themselves with the provided biodegradable tea tree or lavender body wash.								

THE CHANGING TENT				

A large changing tent with lighting & fixtures to hang clothes & towels, allows guests to undress & dress in private.								

THE ATMOSPHERE				

The garden’s social focal point is the large fire bowl with comfortable seating, to warm up & dry yourself down, while our colourful bean bags  bring an intimacy to conversations. 
At night the entire space is thoughtfully lit with candles, fairy lights and little yellow globes, creating an ambiance of rich tranquility.								

SAUNA ETIQUETTE				

GUIDANCE				

Please don’t pour water onto the sauna stones. We have experienced sauna staff who will happily create the magical Loyly we all love, and we have a comprehensive assortment of essential oils to invigorate, or relax, as you wish.								

MINDFULNESS				

Conversation within the sauna is always invited, but please be mindful of others around you, who may be enjoying a moment of introspective meditation.								

PREPAREDNESS				

We ask all sauna guests to bring 2 towels; one for sitting on and one for drying oneself with. We have towels to buy if guests arrive without								

COURTESY

WHAT IS THE COST TO HIRE THE SAUNA FOR AN EVENT?

The cost of hiring the sauna depends on various factors, such as the location, duration of the hire, number of guests, and size of event. Hello Sunshine is busy throughout the summer attending a myriad of wellness festivals.

TESTIMONIALS				

As soon as I'd spoken to Tim on the phone I knew he was the right person for our event, his attitude and approach was very calm and helpful. His set up is gorgeous and he clearly puts a lot of love and care into what he does. I would definitely recommend him and his sauna, and hope to work with him again.

Alex Ingram
																						Director of the Provibers

Tim brought the HelloSunshineSauna to our festival last summer and we loved it, customers and crew alike. Always hot and clean, helpful staff always on hand, their chill out garden beautiful and welcoming.
Tim was a pleasure to work with, super understanding and we soon worked out solutions for our particular needs. We are delighted they are coming back this year and so looking forward to them pampering us all again.

Pony
																						Director Small World Festival 

Tim is the friendliest sauna guy on earth who loves this from the depths of his heart. His sauna is always the hottest and the general vibe he creates is wonderful. He has all the kit you could ever need and literally couldn’t ask for a better sauna situation! We will work with Tim until the day we die 🤩

Nathan Gallager
																						curator of : Love Jam &  Restival

Tim creates a sanctuary to provide the perfect sauna experience. Most importantly the sauna itself is hot, clean and welcoming. I would recommend Tim to anyone (providing their event dates are not the same as mine)!..
